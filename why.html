        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>All meals are included, including sit-down options for breakfast and dinner. Also included is coffee, tea, water, and juice. There is also a 24-hour pizza bar, as well as soft-serve ice cream dispensers all around the ship.</p>
        <p>What's <em>not</em> included: alcoholic beverages and soda. A soda card can be purchased from any bar at the start of the voyage, and if you have kids or a soda guzzler, I <em>strongly</em> recommend getting one.</p>
        <p>There are also several restaurants besides the main dining room on board. These require reservations (though you can often make them day-of), and do have a fee involved. Cucina de Capitano and Ji Ji are $15 a person ($5 for children), and Fahrenheit 555 is $35 a person. There is also a sushi restaurant (Bonsai Sushi) that is a la carte, with items ranging from $1 to $15.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is a coffee shop and bakery that offers custom coffee drinks, shakes, and baked goods. The prices there are a bit below Starbucks.</p>
        <p>As for alcoholic beverages, they're usually priced from $5 to $10. There's a drink card for these as well, though they're more limited, so read the fine print before buying one.</p>
