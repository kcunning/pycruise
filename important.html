        <h1>Important information</h1>
        <p class="lead">If you are planning on attending PyCruise, please, please, please read this section.</p>
        <p>Because cruises take place on international waters, there's some nuances to the rules we'll have to play by. Pretty much everything in this section is due to maritime law, and has nothing to do with Carnival (or any other cruise line, for that matter).</p>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>A passport isn't strictly necessary to go on a cruise ship, but it's probably the easiest piece of documentation you can use.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a passport, you can use one of the following, paired with a photo ID from a state authority:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Original birth certificate</li>
          <li>Certified birth certificate</li>
          <li>A passport card</li>
          <li>An enhanced drivers license</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Children under 16 need to bring proof of citizenship, and children over sixteen need to have a state-issued photo ID of some sort.</p>
        <p>If you're not a US citizen, you'll need your passport. Also, tell the Carnival agent what your home country is, because some ports may require extra waivers.</p>
        <p>The best way to make sure you have the right documents? When you book, be clear about your nationality, ages of all parties, and what documents you have. They're the experts, and can guide you best!</p>
        
        <h2>Age restrictions</h2>
        <p>Guests under the age of 21 years must travel with a parent or legal guardian, with the exception of married couples. Yes, maritime law is weird.</p>
        <p>Also, even though we're in international waters, Carnival abides by US law. No drinking for anyone under 21.</p>

        <h2>Travelling with minors</h2>
        <p>If you're travelling with kids, you don't have to all stay in the same room. There's restrictions on who can have a room without a parent.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Guests 12 and under can be in a seperate room, but must be either next door, or across the hall.</li>
          <li>Guests 13-17 can be booked up to three staterooms away without an adult</li>
          <li>Guests 18-20 can be booked anywhere on the ship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also get an extra key for each room, so that everyone has access to all the rooms. This is called a non-charging Sail and Sign card. You get these from the purser's desk.</p>

        <h2>Travelling with minors when a parent is staying behind</h2>
        <p>If only one legal parent is travelling with their children, it's a good idea to have a letter on hand. It should:
        <ul>
          <li>Be certified (you can get this at most package stores)</li>
          <li>State which children are travelling with you</li>
          <li>State where you will be going, and when you will be getting back</li>
          <li>State what your ports are</li>
          <li>Give the name of the boat</li>
          <li>Be signed by the other parent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've travelled with two minor children on cruises and over borders, and though I've never been asked for this letter, I've always felt better having it on hand.</p>
        <p>This also applies if you're travelling with minors who are not your children. In this instance, you need to get signatures from both parents.</p>
        <p>Again, your best bet is to lay it all on the line for the Carnival agent, and they can tell you what documentation you should bring.</p>
